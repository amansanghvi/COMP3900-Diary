# COMP3900-Diary
Diary for COMP3900

## WEEK 1
We created out group. We decided as a group that we would like to do project 5. As a deliverable for next week we would all like to create a proposal for the project. We are considering the different technologies and languages to implement our project. We are also still analysing requirements and trying to determine what part of the project would suit our different strengths and interests. Ben is our group leader and created a chat so we can communicate.
